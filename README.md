### About me
Currently a student studying computer science at EWU. I have lived in Spokane my whole
life and would like to stay in the pacific northwest for my entire career. I have built 
projects in Java, Python, and many other languages. I have made the Dean's List every quarter
here at EWU and strive to do better every single day. My favorite project is my predictive keyboard 
which was apart of a directive study colloborating with Dr. Tian. It takes a prefix trie and user input to predict what a user is trying to type. I hope to get a job working on video game projects 
or AI, although I have been very interested in airplane mechanics.
